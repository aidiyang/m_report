\section{Experiment}
The estimation problem is tested in Matlab Simulink. The experimental setup consists of the Open HRP3 simulator and the state estimator. The OpenHRP3 (Open Architecture Human-centered Robotics Platform version 3) is an integrated software platform for robot simulations and software developments \footnote{\url{http://www.openrtp.jp/openhrp3/en/about.html}}. It was developed as a cooperative work of University of Tokyo, General Robotix. Inc and National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology(AIST).

%The Kane Screw algortihm is used as the rigid body
