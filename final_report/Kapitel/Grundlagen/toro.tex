\section{Toro}
\emph{Toro} has a complicated kinematic structure as shown in Figure \ref{fig:toro_kin}. It consists of 3 kinematic chains branching from the common base. The hip acts as the common base. The three chains branching from the hip are  upper body, right leg and left leg. The upper body further branches into right hand and left hand. The two arms and legs acts as the end effectors of \emph{Toro}.

\footnotetext{ The joint symbols are explained in Appendix \ref{fig:joint}.}
The generalized coordinates of \emph{Toro} are represented by a vector of joint angles $q$ and the coordinates of the base of robot $x^b$. The number of joints of a robot is the number of controllable degrees of freedom \cite[Chapter 2]{mur94}. The coordinates of the base $x^b$ are the under-actuated degrees of freedom of \emph{Toro}. 

A rigid body in space has six degrees of freedom as shown in Figure \ref{fig:rbody}.

\end{figure}
The translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the rigid body in Figure \ref{fig:rbody} are \emph{x,y,z} and \emph{roll,pitch,yaw}. The rotational degrees of freedom \emph{roll,pitch,yaw} corresponds to rotation of the body around \textbf{X,Y,Z} axes. The base of \emph{Toro} is assumed to be a free rigid body. Since the base has all the six degrees of freedom which corresponds to degrees of freedom of rigid body floating in three dimensional space, it is called floating base. The equation of motion of a single rigid body(floating base) is given by Newton-Euler equation of motion in body coordinates \cite[Chapter 4]{mur94}:
%\footnotetext[1]{Image source:\url{http://www.cncexpo.com/Images/pitchyawroll.jpg}}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dyn_rig_bdy}
\begin{bmatrix}
mI_3 & \textbf{0}_3 \\ \textbf{0}_3 &\Im
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{v}^b\\ \dot{\omega}^b
\end{bmatrix}
+ \begin{bmatrix}
\omega^b \times mv^b \\ 
\omega^b \times \Im w^b
\end{bmatrix}
= W.\\
\end{equation}
In the above equation, \emph{m} is the mass of the rigid body, $\Im$ is the moment of inertia of the rigid body. $I_3$ represents the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix and $ \textbf{0}_3$ represents the  $3 \times 3$ zero matrix. The translation velocity and angular velocity represented in body coordinate frame are ${v}^b$ and $\omega^b$. $W$ is the external wrench applied on the body. A wrench represents a force/moment pair. It is represented by vector in $\Re^6$ as \citep{mur94}
$$ W = \begin{bmatrix} F \\ \tau \end{bmatrix}, $$ where $F \in \Re^3$ is the linear component and $\tau \in \Re^3$ is the rotational component of the generalized force.

The external wrench $W$ acting on the body can be decomposed into wrench due to gravitational forces $g_x^b$ and wrench due to external forces $W^b$: $$ W = W^b - g_x^b.$$

To be consistent with the multibody system dynamics formulation in Equation \ref{eq:dyn_mul_bdy} Newton Euler Equation \ref{eq:dyn_rig_bdy} is reformulated as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dyn_rig_bdy_sh}
M_x^b \dot V^b + C_x^b V^b+g_x^b = W^b,
\end{equation}
 where $x^b=\begin{bmatrix}p \\ \theta\end{bmatrix} \in \Re^6$ is a vector representing the position and orientation of the rigid body with respect to world coordinate frame or spatial frame. The three dimensional position vector is $p=\begin{bmatrix}p_x \\ p_y \\ p_z \end{bmatrix} \in \Re^3$ and the three dimensional orientation vector is $ \theta= \begin{bmatrix} \theta_{x} \\ \theta_{y} \\ \theta_{z} \end{bmatrix} \in \Re^3$. The orientation of the rigid body is parametrised by Euler angles [Appendix \ref{eq:rot_full}]. 
 The body velocity $V^b$ is 
 \begin{equation}
\label{eq:body_vel}
V^b =
\begin{bmatrix}
v^b \\ \omega^b
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
R^T \dot{p} \\ (R^T \dot{R})^\vee
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $\vee$ operator denotes the extraction of 3 dimensional vector from a skew symmetric matrix[Appendix \ref{sec:avel_trfm}]. The rotation matrix $R$ is the matrix dependent on parametrization of Euler angles [Appendix \ref{eq:rot_full}]. The acceleration $\dot{V}^b$ is the acceleration of the rigid body with respect to body frame. $M_x^b$ represents the inertia matrix of the rigid body in body coordinates. $C_x^b$ is the matrix representing the Coriolis and centrifugal forces acting on the system in body coordinates. $g_x^b$ is the vector representing the gravitational forces acting on the body in body coordinates. $W^b$ is the external force applied to the center of mass of the body\footnote[2]{Inertia, Coriolis and gravity are assumed to be given with respect to the body coordinate frame for the rest of the report.}.

The equations of motion of \emph{Toro} in Figure \ref{fig:toro_kin} are composed of equation of motion of the multibody system and equation of motion of single rigid body. The equation of motion of \emph{Toro} is formulated like the equation of motion for a floating base system as given in \cite{ott09}.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dyn_biped}
\begin{bmatrix}
M_x &M_{xq} \\ M_{qx} &M_q
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\ddot{x}^b \\ \ddot{q}
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
C_x &C_{xq} \\ C_{qx} &C_q
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{x}^b \\ \dot{q}
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
g_x \\ g_q
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ \tau
\end{bmatrix}
+ (J_r^b)^T W_r^b + (J_l^b)^T W_l^b,
\end{equation}
where the terms with subscript $x$ are the parameters of floating  base, the terms with subscript $q$ are the parameters of the multibody system and the terms with subscript $xq, qx$ are the coupling terms that connects the dynamics of the floating base with dynamics of the multibody system.

Equation \ref{eq:dyn_biped} can be written in a simplified form as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dyn_sbiped}
M(y)\ddot{y} + C(y,\dot{y})\dot{y} + g(y) = \tau + (J_r^b)^T W_r^b + (J_l^b)^T W_l^b,
\end{equation}
where $y = \begin{bmatrix} x^b \\ q \end{bmatrix}$ is the vector representing the state variables of \emph{Toro}. The generalized coordinates of multibody system is $q \in \Re^{25}$ which represents the vector of joint angles. The vector of generalized velocities is $\dot{y}=\begin{bmatrix} V^{b} \\ \dot{q} \end{bmatrix} \in \Re^{31}.$ The vector of generalized accelerations is $\ddot{y}\in \Re^{31}.$  $M(y)\in \Re^{31 \times 31}$ is the inertia matrix, $C(y,\dot{y})\in \Re^{31 \times 31}$ is the matrix accounting for centrifugal and Coriolis forces. $g(y) \in \Re^{31}$ is the gravity vector. $\tau \in \Re^{31}$ is the vector of actuating torques acting on the robot, where the first six components are zero because those degrees of freedom corresponding to $x_f$ are not actuated. $J_r^b,J_l^b \in \Re^{31 \times 6}$ are the body Jacobian matrices that transforms the wrenches $W_r^b,W_l^b \in \Re^{6}$ applied in the right and left foot to generalized forces acting on the robot. From here on the super script $b$ in body Jacobian matrix and body wrenches is omitted for the sake of simplicity.

The forward dynamics equation of \emph{Toro} is
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:motion}
	\ddot{y} = M(y)^{-1}(-C(y,\dot{y})\dot{y} - g(y) + J_r(y)^{T}W_{r} +J_l(y)^{T}W_{l} + \tau). 
\end{equation}

The inputs $\tau, W_r and W_l$ acting on the system are measured by sensors. For instance the torques $\tau$ are measured by the joint torque sensors and ground reaction forces $W_r,W_l$ are measured by the Force torque sensors (FTS) located at the ankle joint of the robot. These sensor measurements are accompanied by noise. The noise acting on the inputs are $w_\tau,w_{W_r} \text{ and } w_{W_l}$. Incorporating the noise in the froward dynamics equation \ref{eq:motion} results in  
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:motion_noise}
	\ddot{y} = M(y)^{-1}(-C(y,\dot{y})\dot{y} - g(y) + J_r(y)^{T}(W_{r}+w_{W_r}) +J_l(y)^{T}(W_{l} +w_{W_l})+ (\tau+ w_\tau )). 
\end{equation}

\subsection{State space representation:}
The state space representation of \emph{Toro} is formulated similar to the state space representation of multibody system in Equation \ref{eq:dyn_ss}. The state space representation of Equation \ref{eq:motion_noise} is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:newton_motion}
 \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{dy}{dt} \\ \frac{d\dot y}{dt}
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
\dot y \\  M^{-1}(-C\dot{y} - g + J_r^{T}(W_{r}+w_{W_r}) +J_l^{T}(W_{l}+w_{W_l}) + (\tau+w_\tau)) 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where $\dot y = \begin{bmatrix} V^b \\ \dot q \end{bmatrix}$. The body velocity $V^b$ is given in Equation \ref{eq:body_vel}. In order for th system to be integrable the linear part of the body velocity is rearranged as 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:transfo_linvel}
    \dot p = R v^b.
\end{equation}
Likewise the angular part of the body velocity can be reformulated as 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:transfo_angvel}
    \omega^b = T(\theta)\dot{\theta},
\end{equation}
where $T(\theta)$ is the transformation matrix [Appendix \ref{sec:avel_trfm}]. 

 The state space representation of \emph{Toro} is obtained by substituting Equations \ref{eq:transfo_linvel} and \ref{eq:transfo_angvel} in Equation \ref{eq:newton_motion}. 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:toro}
	\dot{x} = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\dot{p} \\ \dot{\theta} \\ \dot{q} \\ \ddot{y}
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
	R v^b\\	
	T(\theta)^{-1} \omega_f^b \\
	\dot{q}\\
	M^{-1}(-C\dot{y} - g + J_r^{T}(W_{r}+w_{W_r}) +J_l^{T}(W_{l}+w_{W_l}) + (\tau+w_\tau))	
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The measurements of \emph{Toro} are Cartesian accelerations($acc^b$) of the hip measured by accelerometer, angular velocity($\omega^b$) of the hip measured by the gyroscope, joint angles($q_j$) and joint velocities($\dot{q_j}$) measured by joint encoders.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:y_sens}
     y_{sens} = \begin{bmatrix} acc^b \\ \omega^b \\ q_j \\ \dot{q}_j \end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The simplified model of $IMU_{acc}$ is $$ acc^b= \begin{bmatrix} acc^b_x \\ acc^b_y \\ acc^b_z \end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix}\ddot{p}_x^b \\ \ddot{p}_y^b \\ \ddot{p}_z^b \end{bmatrix} - R^T \begin{bmatrix}0 \\0 \\-9.81 \end{bmatrix}$$ \emph{R} is the rotational matrix that transforms a vector in body coordinate frame to spatial frame.
    \item $\ddot{p}^b$ is computed from the forward dynamic equation \ref{eq:motion} using the predicted values of the state
    \item $\omega_{f}^{b} $ is the vector of angular rates of the hip(floating base) measured by gyroscope. The measurements are in the frame attached to the hip. 
\end{itemize}

    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Along with the sensor measurements kinematic constraints can also be introduced as measurements \citep{atk12}. The kinematic constraint that is considered as measurement is the position constraint. For instance when the robot is tilting around an edge, the position of the points that are lying on that edge does not change with respect to the spatial frame (world frame). 
 
 Figure \ref{fig:biped_feet} shows the contact points considered for measurements. The corner points of each foot are measured with respect to spatial frame \emph{S}. The measurement equation of these contact points are
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:y_kin}
    y_{kin} = s_{contact} = \begin{bmatrix}s_{r}\\ s_{l}\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation} where
$s_{r},s_{l}$ are the vectors of contact points in right foot and left foot defined with respect to spatial frame. They are given as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:y_cnt}
    \begin{split}
    s_{r} &= \begin{bmatrix} s_{A,r}\\ s_{B,r}\\ s_{C,r}\\ s_{D,r}\end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} {H}_{r}s_{A}\\  {H}_{r}s_{B}\\  {H}_{r}s_{C}\\  {H}_{r}s_{D}\end{bmatrix} \\
    s_{l} &= \begin{bmatrix} s_{A,l}\\ s_{B,l}\\ s_{C,l}\\ s_{D,l}\end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} {H}_{l}s_{A}\\  {H}_{l}s_{B}\\  {H}_{l}s_{C}\\  {H}_{l}s_{D}\end{bmatrix} \\
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where ${H}_{r},{H}_{l}$ are the homogeneous transformation matrices of the right and left foot with respect to spatial frame [Appendix \ref{sec:htm}]
 In Figure \ref{fig:biped_feet} $s_A,s_B,s_C,s_D$ are constant with respect to the foot coordinate frames \emph{RF,LF}. They are given as 
 $$ s_A = \begin{bmatrix} 0.13 \\ 0.0475 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} , 
    s_B = \begin{bmatrix} 0.13 \\ -0.0475 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
    s_C = \begin{bmatrix} -0.06 \\ -0.0475 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \text{ and }
    s_D = \begin{bmatrix} -0.06 \\ 0.0475 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.$$

\paragraph{Contact switching:} The measurement of the contact points $s_{cnt}$\footnote{$s_{cnt}$ is the short form of $s_{contact}$ in Equation \ref{eq:y_kin}.} with respect to the spatial frame (world coordinate frame) are made before starting the experiment. These measurements are made under the circumstance where the feet of the robot make surface contact with the ground. For instance when the robot is standing on one foot then the contact measurements from the other foot are not valid. A parameter $\alpha$, that makes use of the vertical reaction force $F_z$ measured by Force Torque Sensor (FTS) on each foot to determine the support case \citep{atk12}:$$ \alpha = \frac{F_{z,r} + F_{z,l}}{F_{z,r}}.$$ 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\input{Bilder/tilt_cases.tex}
	\caption{Foot support cases determined using parameter $\alpha$}
	\label{fig:support_cases}
\end{figure}

The valid contact points are chosen based on the support case in Figure \ref{fig:support_cases}. The validity of the contact measurements can also change based on the type of contact the robot makes with the ground. For instance let us consider the robot is standing on its right leg. When the robot is tilting about the back edge of the foot, the front edge lifts off the ground which implies the contact changes from surface to line. The robot is only supported by the back edge of the foot. In this case the measurements of points $s_{C,r}$ and $s_{D,r}$ are valid, but $s_{A,r}$ and $s_B,r$ are invalid. So it is important to determine the state of contact of the robot with ground (surface or line). 

The Zero moment point (ZMP) is an useful criteria for detecting the state of contact. The coordinates of ZMP = $[{zmp}_{x},{zmp}_{y}]^T$ are defined with respect to the foot coordinate frame. As long as the ZMP is inside the support polygon\footnote{The support polygon refers to the surface of the foot that is in contact with the ground.} the robot will be in surface contact. The ZMP cannot be outside the support polygon (foot) \citep{mio04}. When the ZMP is located at the boundary of the support polygon then the robot changes from surface to line contact. In this case the contact will be about the line where the ZMP is located. Figure \ref{fig:biped_feet} shows the support polygons of right and left foot of \emph{Toro}. For instance when the ZMP is located at the back edge of a right foot's support in Figure \ref{fig:biped_feet}, then the contact is about the line (CD\footnote{From here on the line joining the points $s_X$ and $s_Y$ will be represented by XY.}) joining points $s_C$ and $s_D$. In this case the robot starts tilting about the line CD.

	\caption{Line contacts of left foot in Figure \ref{fig:biped_feet} determined by \emph{ZMP}}
	\label{fig:zmp_cases}
\end{figure}

Each tilting case in Figure \ref{fig:zmp_cases} have different sets of contact points. The Algorithm \ref{alg:cnt_switch} is useful in making the decision about the contact points $s_{cnt}$ based on number of support and state of contact.
